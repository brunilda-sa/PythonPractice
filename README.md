## Introduction
Here you are going find all the daily Python practice

## Practice title: List_Less_Than_Ten
Take a list, say for example this one: a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

## Practice title: Odd_Or_Even
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

## Practice title: character_Input
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
